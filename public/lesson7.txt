We have been working inside of the same file as our main website. However, that seems like a horrible way to maintain our JavaScript code. The best way to maintain this is put your code in file(s) in an external file then link those files together using a script tag.

For Example:

Internal JavaScript:

[File: index.html]

<html>
...
<script>
	var headings = document.getElementByTagName("h1");

	for(var i = 0; i < body.length; i++){
		headings[i].style.color = "Brown";
	}
</script>
</body>
</html>


-However, this is what we want to NOT do. So how does this work...

External JavaScript:

[File: index.html]

<html>
...
<script src = "js/app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[File: app.js] in the folder js

var headings = document.getElementByTagName("h1");

for(var i = 0; i < body.length; i++){
	headings[i].style.color = "Brown";
}
