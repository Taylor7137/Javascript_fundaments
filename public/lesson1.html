JavaScript is a manner to add interactivity and programmatic control over portions of your site. Despite have a name that is shared with the ever so popular Java programming language (depends on who you talk to), there is little shared between the two languages other than some curly braces, parentheses, and semicolons.

JavaScript has come a long way in its history. The language is interpreted, which means that the language is not transformed into machine code (language the computer can understand) before the program is actually run. In essence, there is an on the fly transformation that allows the computer to understand what you are asking it to do. (Not the most technical definition and some details are glossed over, but this explanation is sufficient for our purposes.)

JavaScript is built into most modern web browsers. If you have ever programmed before then you will see similar programmatic constructs that other languages possess such as if/else, loops (iterative structures), variables, and various ways of handling data. However, JavaScript departs from some other languages based on the way that data is handled and what can be passed between pieces of code. (If that doesn't make sense then do not worry, the understanding will come in due time.) Moreover, most browsers allow JavaScript to interact with aspects of a web page which allows some interesting things to occur... I think that is enough background, let's get started!
